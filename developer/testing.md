# Run tests

## Full verification

```sh
pnpm check:versions
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
docker compose config
```

Unit tests cover metadata, security, data APIs, CLI, and UI utilities. Server integration tests use Fastify injection and temporary/in-memory databases. Add authorization and failure-path tests for every administrative endpoint.

Release candidates also require a Windows updater exercise and a Docker smoke update that proves the named volume survives container replacement.
